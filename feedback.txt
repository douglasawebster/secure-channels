We spent twenty hours on this assignment, possibly more? I lost track at a certain point and we ended up doing a lot of solo work. Most of the problems we had ended up being things with the encodings and byte strings vs strings that I still don't entirely understand. I've spent the past week (~5 hours), with everything in the assignment completed except mallory's attack 4, because despite understanding the theory (break the message into 128 bit blocks and you can just delete blocks from the end at will), making that actually work under the binary encodings we're using is a hellscape.
