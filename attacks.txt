4. Show how Mallory can undetectedly modify a message that is sent with symmetric encryption only.

This SHOULD be possible but I can't get the blocks to behave

5. Show how Mallory can undetectedly replay an old message that is sent with Enc-then-MAC

Start the system in EncThenMac configuration.
Have Alice send some message M1 to Mallory
Mallory will recieve and display the message, then prompt for behavior. Enter 4 (store) and y(es) to confirm. This will store the message. You will be prompted for behavior again, input 1 (pass on) to pass the original message to Bob. 
Bob will recieve the message M1
Have Alice send a new message M2
When Mallory prompts for behavior, enter 5 (replay), y(es) to replay the stored message
